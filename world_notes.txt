Currupty City: Prosperity city.

The police force- Is a small army.

The booster gangs are still present in little ittily and china, and slumbs.
Local gans are funded by external forces for local intrests.

We begin in the strip-joint, the fat angle. There are strippers. We are meeting up, to discuss night-runner's plans. A new corporate TGH-genetics is our target, break into the server room, and steal information.

Spends $24 on beers & frendship.


We're in the back of the room, with tables and benches in the back. Round tables in the middle of the room around a long walkway. The bar is accorss the walkway. It is loud and noisy.

There are a few law informants about, but they are minding their own business, with their beers, and the entertainment. 

We have a controller named `v`, who is our eyes and ears throughout the operation, and we were put in contact via night-runner.

Security is lax at the moment, for this building. Two ways in: A direct route, and a quiter sneakyer one.
The routes don't matter if you get detected.
